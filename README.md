# demo-greylog
Graylog is a log management tool that seamlessly collects, enhances, stores, and analyzes log data.

Log data is stored in Elasticsearch and is searchable through the Graylog GUI.
Elasticsearch nodes should have as much RAM as possible and the fastest disks you can get. Everything depends on I/O speed here.
MongoDB is used to store meta information and configuration data. and doesnâ€™t need many resources.
